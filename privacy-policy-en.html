    <h2>üìã Introduction</h2>

    <h2>üîí What Makes MyVPN Different</h2>
    <p>MyVPN is designed with privacy-by-design principles. Unlike traditional VPN services, MyVPN puts you in complete control:</p>

      <li><strong>You manage your data</strong> - Your traffic goes through your chosen servers</li>
      <li><strong>We don't see your activity</strong> - Your connections are between you and your servers</li>
      <li><strong>Local storage only</strong> - All configurations are stored on your device</li>
    </ul>
